# EXP 5: Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon = input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output
